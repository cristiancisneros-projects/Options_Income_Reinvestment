#Remark: this is my high risk option premium reinvestment calculator for growth due to dynamic premiums, share accumulation, & compounding returns.
#Remark: We make the assumptions: price is stationary, option premiums do not change, bid-ask is $0.05-$0.10 for Calls, $0.10-$0.25 for Puts
#Remark: The only kind of options traded in this model are Covered Calls and Cash Secured Puts. There will be no purchasing of options but only shorting them.
#Remark: The model is currently adapted to only 1 stock; I trade Volatile Asian Penny Stocks since there are high premiums & cheap share prices. "NFA"

#IMPORTANT: The purpose of this model is not to accumulate purchasing power; it is to accumulate shares over time with re-invested purchasing power
